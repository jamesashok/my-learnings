# Page Level Content

- content the user interacts with like images, tables, links, articles...
- Accessible colors and contrast
  - Poor color combinations can cause issues for user with vision impairment or for users viewing under low/high light environments.
  - WCAG 2.1 level AA for color contrast requirements are complex to understand.
  - Use accessibility tools and color contrast tools to identify right fg/bg color combinations.
  - Contrast ratio requirement of at least 4.5:1 between text (and image text) and bg behind the text.
- Decorative & Descriptive images
  - `alt` attribute mandatory for both.
  - `alt` value is not required for decorative images.
- Semantic elements
- Keyboard focus and Mouse hover
- Clear link text (AAA)
  - Avoid 'Click here', 'Read more'... links as screen readers may not understand the context behind the links.
  - Use clear and short link text that is self explanatory for all users.
- Group related links
  - Grouping related menu links with lists like `<ul>` helps screen readers to provide additional context to the users.
  - Do not over use this technique for all links, as it can result in extra noise / listening fatigue to the user.
- Datatables for tabular data
  - `<caption>` - first child of `<table>` | a brief description of the table and its data.
  - `<th scope="col">` - `scope` attr to associate header cells with data cells.
