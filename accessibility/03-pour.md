- **Guidelines**
  - 3.1 - readable and understandable text,
  - 3.2 - web pages to appear and operate in predictable ways,
  - 3.3 - help users avoid and correct mistakes,

## Robust
- reliably interpreted by various user agents and assistive techs.
- **Guidelines 4.1** - maximise compatibility with current and future user agents and assistive techs.
